Quick Example

This short example assumes Consul is installed locally.

Start a Consul cluster in dev mode:

$ consul agent -dev
Author a template in.tpl to query the kv store:

{{ key "foo" }}
Start Consul Template:

$ consul-template -template "in.tpl:out.txt" -once
Write data to the key in Consul:

$ consul kv put foo bar
Observe Consul Template has written the file out.txt:

$ cat out.txt
